                            I grew up in Davis, CA, a small-ish town in the valley of California. Unlike most small towns in the middle
                            of farmland, there is a decent chance that you (likely an academic) know of my hometown
                            as the location of UC Davis. 
                            I moved to the East Coast in 2013 to get my bachelor's at Tufts University, where I was advised by
                            <a href="https://cosmos.phy.tufts.edu/~danilo/Home.html">Danilo Marchesini</a>. In 2017, I moved down
                            to Princeton for graduate school; my advisor was <a href="https://crispygreene.wix.com/jenny">Jenny Greene</a>.
                            I got my PhD in 2022, after which I moved slightly north to Connecticut 
                            where I became a YCAA Prize Fellow at the <a href="https://ycaa.yale.edu/">Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>; 
                            in 2025, I'll head back to California as a Kavli fellow at the <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/">Kavli Center for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)</a>.

                                    The Merian Survey will capture
                                    spatially-resolved emission properties for an estimated 100,000 dwarfs down to an H&alpha; equivalent width of
                                    10 &#8491; and a stellar mass of 10<sup>8</sup> solar masses. 
                                    Merian has two main science goals: to characterize the star formation properties of bright dwarfs, and to measure 
                                    the stellar-to-halo mass relation of low-mass galaxies via weak lensing.
                                    The survey utilizes two custom-built medium-band filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) 
                                    centered on [OIII] and H&alpha; emission at 
                                    0.06&lt;z&lt;0.10 that will cover around 800 square degrees of the HSC-SSP footprint.

                        My main interest is in the low-mass galaxy regime, where I think about how 
                        dwarf galaxies can inform our understanding of physics at both larger and smaller scales. 
                        I have a particular interest in the relationship between the star formation cycle and 
                        the dwarf population as a way to understand both the physics of star formation regulation and 
                        as a driver of the diversity of the dwarf population.

                                    The total stellar mass of a galaxy is one of the most important physical properties of a galaxy; a galaxy's stellar mass is expected to correlate with its halo mass and assembly history, and plays an important role in setting the galaxy structure and intragalactic environment. Measuring stellar masses is commonplace, but the uncertainties and biases related to these estimates have not been well-characterized in the dwarf mass regime. Here, we demonstrate that broadband photometry are able to recover model galaxy stellar masses to a precision of around 0.1 dex, but that a new calibration is needed to eliminate mass-dependent biases. We also show that while non-parametric SED fitting can recover unbiased estimates of the stellar mass, parametric SED fitting may underestimate stellar mass by up to around 0.4 dex.

                                    The efficiency at which star formation feedback drives galactic winds in dwarf galaxies underpins the physical processes of dwarf assembly and informs 
                                    physical models of star formation regulation. We model both observational and physical effects to infer a moderate wind-driving efficiency 
                                    that is consistent with modern ISM-scale simulations, but over an order of magnitude lower than what some cosmological simulations 
                                    use to produce dwarf galaxies that are realistic in other aspects.

                                    As the size of our imaging datasets increase, finding dwarf galaxies at scale is becoming an increasingly difficult proposition: 
                                    standard photometric distance determinations are 
                                    not sufficiently precise, and spectroscopic surveys are prohibitively resource-intensive. We designed and manufactured a set of two medium-band filters purpose-built to
                                    find 100,000 dwarfs via their [OII] and H&alpha; line emission at 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.10 for the Merian Survey.

                                    be non-star-forming, but the physical processes that lead to satellite quenching are poorly understood. We
                                    catalog the star-forming properties of the satellite systems of 101 nearby Milky Way-like hosts in the SAGA survey 
                                    to examine the imprint of host environment on the present and past star formation of low-mass galaxies.

                                    The future of a small galaxy is irreparably altered if it falls into the gravitational potential of a more massive host. Indeed, the
                                    gravitational and hydrodynamical effects exerted by massive galaxies on their satellites contribute strongly to the observed
                                    diversity in the structures of low-mass galaxies. However, here we show that the lowest density dwarfs are quenched at a rate 
                                    similar to their denser analogs. This result runs contrary to the naive expectation in which the processes that allow for very low
                                    stellar densities also lead low-density dwarfs to be more susceptible to environmental disruption.

                                    Ultra-diffuse galaxies are called as such due to their large sizes and low surface brightnesses. Canonically, however, 
                                    these galaxies have been defined with a flat cut in surface brightness and physical size. We argue that defining galaxies based on

                                    influence of a massive host galaxy. These structures provide insight into a galaxy's recent merger history, the

                                    Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies, or UDGs, are dwarf galaxies with remarkably low stellar densities; this diffuse
                                    nature makes UDGs an extreme environment for star formation. Here, we map out the stellar mass and star formation 
                                    rate surface densities of a sample of nearby gas-rich UDGs. We find that the UDGs are systematically less efficient
                                    at forming stars given the size of their gas reservoirs, and that although these puffy galaxies are large for their 
                                    stellar mass, their sizes are actually normal for their HI masses.

                                    The stellar outskirts of massive galaxies are thought to be dominated by stars deposited by accreted satellite 
                                    galaxies; they thus encode substantial information about galaxies' unique assembly histories. Because these outskirts
                                    are low density and therefore low surface-brightness, it is especially important to disentangle systematic effects of
                                    data reduction and processing that may impact inferred outskirt properties. Here, we compare the limits of wide-field 
                                    survey instruments and propose new methods to subtract the sky background in order to accurately delve into the stellar 
                                    outskirts of massive galaxies.

                                    The incoming generation of space-based missions will greatly expand the distance at which we are able to 
                                    resolve galaxy light into individual stars. These resolved star studies are able to leverage our knowledge of stellar physics
                                    and evolution to infer galaxy distances, stellar population ages, and enrichment histories. Here we develop a new tool

                                    Characterizing the low surface-brightness tail of the galaxy population is crucial for quantifying 
                                    the full diversity of the galaxy population. In this work, we use a cross-correlation approach to 
                                    infer the redshift distribution of the low surface brightness galaxy catalog of Greco et al. 2018; we find that the  galaxies selected via 
                                    low-surface brightness detection methods from HSC-SSP typically have stellar masses of around
                                    10<sup>7</sup> solar masses and, unlike Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies,
                                    lie on the mass-size relation at a distance of approximately 100 Mpc.

                                    Our previous work demonstrated that bright dwarfs generically host three-dimensionally round 
                                    stellar outskirts; here, we consider whether the strong star formation feedback prescriptions
                                    of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) simulations are able to reproduce these structures.
                                    We find that although the FIRE-2 galaxies do redistribute stars to large radii, many of the simulated 
                                    dwarfs fail to form the thick disks that appear in the observed population. The simulated galaxies that 
                                    do not form disks are also characterized by burstier star formation histories and lower cold gas fractions 
                                    than the dwarfs that form disks, suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of galaxies is a 
                                    key benchmark linked to star formation feedback and galaxy assembly.
